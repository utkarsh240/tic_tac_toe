# Tic-Tac-Toe (N x N)

This project is an extended version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Instead of the traditional 3x3 board, this version allows a customizable `N x N` board where a player needs `M` consecutive marks to win.


- Customizable board size (`N`)
- Customizable win condition (`M` in a row)
- Detects wins in all directions: horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals
- Displays game status: next player, winner, or draw
- Reset button to restart the game at any point
- Built using React and Tailwind CSS
